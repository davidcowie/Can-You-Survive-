# Can-You-Survive-
Can you Survive is a overhead, top-down, shooter game that I created my freshman year. It features multiple game states, including a demo mode in which the computer plays as the player. There is also a store in-game, where after completing a round the player can purchase different guns and equip them. All the guns have different attributes, ranging from damage to reload time. High scores are saved and can be viewed from the main menu.
